# Threat Modeling Skill

This skill provides systematic threat modeling capabilities using industry-standard methodologies to identify, analyze, and prioritize security threats in complex systems.

## Core Capabilities

### 2. Risk Assessment
- **Likelihood Evaluation**: Probability of successful attacks
- **Impact Analysis**: Business and technical consequences

- **Quantitative Modeling**: Expected annual loss calculations

### 3. Mitigation Strategy
- **Control Selection**: Preventive, detective, and corrective controls
- **Defense in Depth**: Layered security architecture
- **Residual Risk**: Remaining risk after mitigations
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Threat landscape evolution

### 4. Documentation & Communication
- **Threat Models**: Visual representations and narratives
- **Risk Registers**: Centralized risk tracking
- **Security Requirements**: Derived from threat analysis

```

## Threat Modeling Process

### Phase 1: System Understanding
```
Architecture Analysis:
• System boundaries and scope
• Data flow diagrams (DFDs)
• Trust boundaries identification
• External dependencies mapping

Components Inventory:
• Web servers and applications
• Databases and data stores
• Network infrastructure
• Third-party services
• Human processes

Data Classification:
• Sensitive data identification
• Data flow mapping
• Storage locations
• Processing activities
• Retention requirements
```

### Phase 2: Threat Identification
```
Threat Enumeration:
Using STRIDE per element:

Process Threats:
├── Spoofing: Fake service instances
├── Tampering: Code injection attacks
├── Repudiation: Log manipulation
├── Information Disclosure: Memory dumps
├── Denial of Service: Resource exhaustion
└── Elevation of Privilege: Buffer overflows

Data Store Threats:
├── Spoofing: Rogue databases
├── Tampering: Direct DB access
├── Repudiation: Audit trail gaps
├── Information Disclosure: Data dumps
├── Denial of Service: Storage exhaustion
└── Elevation of Privilege: DB admin access

Data Flow Threats:
├── Spoofing: Man-in-the-middle
├── Tampering: Packet modification
├── Repudiation: Message alteration
├── Information Disclosure: Eavesdropping
├── Denial of Service: Connection flooding
└── Elevation of Privilege: Protocol exploits
```

### Phase 3: Risk Analysis
```
Likelihood Assessment:
• Threat actor capabilities
• Attack complexity
• Required resources
• Detection probability
• Success rate

Impact Assessment:
• Confidentiality impact
• Integrity impact  
• Availability impact
• Business disruption
• Regulatory violations
• Reputation damage

Risk Calculation:
Risk = Likelihood × Impact × Vulnerability

Where:
• Likelihood: 1-5 scale (Very Low to Very High)
• Impact: 1-5 scale (Minimal to Catastrophic)  
• Vulnerability: 0.1-1.0 (Well Protected to Exposed)
```

### Phase 4: Mitigation Planning
```
Control Categories:

PREVENTIVE CONTROLS:
• Input validation
• Authentication mechanisms
• Authorization checks
• Encryption implementation
• Network segmentation

DETECTIVE CONTROLS:
• Logging and monitoring
• Intrusion detection
• Anomaly detection
• Security scanning
• Audit mechanisms

CORRECTIVE CONTROLS:
• Incident response
• Backup and recovery
• Patch management
• Configuration management
• Business continuity

DETERRENT CONTROLS:
• Security policies
• Legal agreements
• Awareness training
• Physical security
• Compliance monitoring
```
